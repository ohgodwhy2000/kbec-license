# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to report issues and submit changes so maintainers can review them quickly.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and professional. Report unacceptable behavior by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers.

## How to Contribute

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open an issue to discuss larger changes before implementing them.
3. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch (e.g., `fix/typo-readme`, `feat/add-license-option`).
4. Make commits that are focused and clearly described.

## Pull Request Checklist

- **Describe:** Link the issue and explain the change briefly.
- **Clean commits:** Rebase/squash related work into logical commits.
- **Formatting:** Run repository linters and formatters if present.

## Writing Style

Follow the existing style in the repository. Keep changes small and focused. If the project has automated style checks, run them before submitting a PR.

## Commit Messages

Use clear, imperative-style messages. Example: `Fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md` or `Add commercial license inquiry template`.

## Small Changes

For tiny fixes (typos, docs), a single small PR is preferred.

## Questions

If you're unsure how to proceed, open an issue explaining your idea and tag maintainers for guidance.
