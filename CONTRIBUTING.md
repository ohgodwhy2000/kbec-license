# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to report issues and submit changes so maintainers can review them quickly.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and professional. Report unacceptable behavior by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers.

## How to Contribute

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open an issue to discuss larger changes before implementing them.
3. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch (e.g., `fix/typo-readme`, `feat/add-license-option`).
4. Make commits that are focused and clearly described.

## Pull Request Checklist

- **Describe:** Link the issue and explain the change briefly.
- **Clean commits:** Rebase/squash related work into logical commits.
- **Tests:** Add or update tests if applicable.
- **Formatting:** Run repository linters and formatters if present.
- **CLA:** Sign the Contributor License Agreement. See `CLA-template.md` for the template and instructions.

## Writing Style

Follow the existing style in the repository. Keep changes small and focused. If the project has automated style checks, run them before submitting a PR.

## Commit Messages

Use clear, imperative-style messages. Example: `Fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md` or `Add commercial license inquiry template`.

## Small Changes

For tiny fixes (typos, docs), a single small PR is preferred.

## Licensing and CLA

By contributing you confirm that your contributions are your original work (or you have the right to submit them) and that you agree to the terms of the project CLA. See `CLA-template.md` for details.

## Questions

If you're unsure how to proceed, open an issue explaining your idea and tag maintainers for guidance.
